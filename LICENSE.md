I recognize the name cannot stay, and will be changed soon. Until such time, I will not be posting this under a specific license. You may fork and redistribute this code as you see fit, I ask that you keep it open source, but I am not requiring it to be so. Also, this project is inspired by Cosmic Ark by Imagic for the Atari 2600, but is not meant to be a clone or take any credit or claim of ownership from Imagic or Atari. This is a temporary name meant to pay homage to the game which inspired this project.
